## 1. Project Overview

This interactive web application is a technical exercise developed for AECOM's Urban Advisory team. It demonstrates a rapid-prototyping approach to a common urban analytics task: calculating pedestrian accessibility.

The core requirement was to build an automated workflow that, given a user-selected point and distance, calculates the accessible street network and catchment area using open-source data. This solution fulfills that request and extends it with strategically relevant features designed to integrate seamlessly into the team's workflow, bridging the gap between computational analysis and practical, data-driven insights.

The result is a polished, user-friendly tool that allows any user to generate and export professional-grade analysis in seconds.

## 3. Features

- **Polished & Intuitive UI:** A clean, modern interface designed for clarity and ease of use, featuring interactive controls and a responsive layout.
- **Interactive Map Interface:** Users can pan, zoom, and **click any point on the map** to define the center of their analysis, or use the search bar to center the map on a specific address or landmark.
- **Dynamic Catchment Calculation:** An interactive slider allows for the dynamic setting of the pedestrian catchment distance (isochrone) from 100m to 2000m.
- **Core Analytics:** Calculates and prominently displays key metrics in clear, card-based components:
    1.  The **total length of accessible streets** within the catchment.
    2.  The **total area of the catchment polygon**.
- **Insightful POI Analysis:** Automatically queries OpenStreetMap for key urban amenities within the catchment and presents a clean, aggregated summary table.
- **BI & Reporting Integration:** Includes a one-click **"Download CSV"** button for the amenity breakdown, allowing for seamless integration with tools like Excel and Power BI.
- **Professional GIS Integration:** Features a **"Download GIS"** button that bundles the three key spatial layers (street network, catchment polygon, POIs) into a single `.zip` file, containing both **Shapefile** and **GeoJSON** formats for immediate use in ArcGIS or QGIS.

## 4. Technology Stack

This application was built entirely in Python, leveraging a stack of powerful open-source libraries:

-   **Backend & Geospatial Core:**
    -   **Python 3.11**
    -   **OSMnx:** For accessing, modeling, and analyzing real-world street networks from OpenStreetMap.
    -   **GeoPandas:** The fundamental library for working with geospatial data in Python.
    -   **NetworkX:** For performing the graph-based network analysis to generate the isochrone.
    -   **Shapely:** For all underlying geometric operations.
-   **Frontend & UI:**
    -   **Streamlit:** To rapidly build and deploy the interactive web application.
    -   **Folium:** For generating the interactive Leaflet.js map visualizations.
-   **Dependencies:**
    -   **mapclassify:** A required dependency for advanced geospatial visualizations.
    -   **scikit-learn:** Used by OSMnx for efficient spatial indexing on unprojected graphs.

## 5. Methodology

-   **Network-Based Catchment (Isochrone):** The analysis intentionally avoids a simple circular buffer. Instead, it calculates a true network isochrone by finding all street segments reachable from the origin point within the specified walking distance. This provides a much more realistic assessment of pedestrian accessibility, which is critical for urban planning.
-   **Catchment Area Definition:** The final catchment polygon is generated by creating a **Convex Hull** around all the nodes of the accessible street network. I chose this method as it's a standard and computationally efficient way to define a clear boundary for the catchment.
-   **On-the-Fly Data Fetching:** All data is queried live from the OpenStreetMap API via OSMnx. This ensures the analysis is always based on the most current data available and is not reliant on any static, pre-downloaded datasets.
-   **Robust Data Handling:** I designed the application to gracefully handle real-world data inconsistencies from OSM, such as POIs represented by polygons or points, and missing data tags.

## 6. Local Setup and Usage

To run this application on a local machine, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4.  The application will open in a new tab in your default web browser.
